# 🕸️ Data Processing and Web Scraping Project

## 📖 Overview
This project automates the extraction, processing, and analysis of web data using **Python**.  
It leverages **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy** for web scraping, **pandas** for data cleaning and analysis, and **SQLite** for structured data storage.  

You can easily adapt it to scrape any public website for structured information such as quotes, news, job listings, or product details.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 **Automated Web Scraping:** Extract data (quotes, authors, and tags) from multiple pages.  
- 🧩 **HTML Parsing:** Uses **BeautifulSoup** and **lxml** for efficient HTML parsing.  
- 🕷️ **Scalable Crawling:** Includes a **Scrapy**-based spider for larger datasets.  
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Cleans text, handles lists, and removes duplicates using **pandas**.  
- 💾 **Data Storage:** Saves results as both **CSV** and **SQLite database**.  
- 📊 **Basic Analysis:** Displays top authors and most common tags.  
- 🔐 **Polite Crawling:** Custom user-agent, request delays, and robots.txt compliance.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/web-scraper.git
cd web-scraper
2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

3️⃣ Activate It

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate


On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

4️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

🕵️‍♂️ Run the Scrapers
▶️ Run the BeautifulSoup Scraper
python scrape_quotes_bs4.py


Fetches quotes, authors, and tags from quotes.toscrape.com
 and saves results in quotes.csv.

🧼 Process and Clean the Data
python process_data.py


Cleans and analyzes the scraped data. Outputs:

quotes_clean.csv → Cleaned data

quotes.db → SQLite database

🕷️ (Optional) Run the Scrapy Spider
cd quotes_spider
scrapy crawl quotes -O quotes.csv

📘 How It Works — Step by Step
🔹 Scraping

Sends HTTP requests using requests or Scrapy.

Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup or CSS selectors.

🔹 Data Cleaning

Removes unwanted spaces and duplicates.

Converts lists (like ['life', 'humor']) into comma-separated strings.

Fills missing values.

🔹 Data Storage

Stores processed data in multiple formats:

quotes.csv

quotes_clean.csv

quotes.db (SQLite)

🔹 Analysis

Uses pandas to count top authors and most frequent tags.

Prints summary statistics to the console.

🧠 Future Enhancements

📊 Add a Streamlit dashboard for interactive data visualization.

💬 Integrate NLTK or spaCy for sentiment analysis on quotes.

☁️ Deploy to the cloud (AWS Lambda or EC2).

🧩 Support multiple websites with configuration-based scraping.

⚙️ Use Playwright or Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites.

⚖️ Legal and Ethical Note

Always check and respect a website’s robots.txt and terms of service.

Avoid scraping sensitive or private data.

Use scraping responsibly and rate-limit requests to prevent server overload.
